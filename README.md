# Unemployment Analysis ‚Äî Data Science Project

## üìò Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the **unemployment rate** trends across different regions during the **COVID-19 pandemic**.  
By using real-world unemployment data, this project aims to explore how the pandemic affected the labor force and identify regions or sectors most impacted by rising unemployment levels.

## üß© Steps Performed

### 1. *Data Loading*
- Loaded the **Unemployment dataset** (downloaded from the provided source) into a pandas DataFrame.  
- Inspected the dataset structure, column names, and basic statistics.

### 2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
- Analyzed unemployment rate variations across **different states, months, and regions**.  
- Visualized trends using *line charts*, *bar graphs*, and *heatmaps*.  
- Explored correlations between **labor participation rate**, **employment rate**, and **unemployment rate**.

### 3. *Data Preprocessing*
- Handled missing or inconsistent values where necessary.  
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format for time-based analysis.  
- Filtered and grouped data to identify patterns during different phases of the pandemic.

### 4. *Statistical & Visual Insights*
- Computed descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients to understand relationships between variables.  
- Created visualizations showing:
  - State-wise unemployment trends  
  - Regional unemployment comparison  
  - Month-wise unemployment rate change during COVID-19

### 5. *Predictive Analysis (Optional)*
- Built a simple regression model (e.g., *Linear Regression*) to forecast unemployment trends.  
- Compared predicted vs actual values to assess model performance.

## üèÅ Outcome
- Identified a **sharp rise in unemployment rates** during early COVID-19 lockdown months.  
- Found significant **regional variation** ‚Äî some states experienced much higher unemployment compared to others.  
- Visualizations clearly highlighted how the labor market responded to the pandemic‚Äôs economic impact.  
- The project demonstrates how **data analysis and visualization** can provide valuable insights into real-world socio-economic issues.
